# Inline asm in CUDA/HIP
This repo shows an CUDA/HIP example on how to measure the clock cycles taken to compute a bunch of Fibonacci numbers by a single GPU thread. The clocks are measured by inserting inline asm into the GPU kernel. See the Xdevice directory for the CUDA/HIP implementation details.
